# candy strrrike

**what is this**

this is my precious baby CANDY STRRRIKE, my first ever godot project: a candy-themed lighthearted action platformer, in which you defeat a certain amount of enemies in a chaotic platformerish setting to move on to the next level (there are 3)
it is highly unlikely you beat this game without dying :)

**why?**

i love coding. i love candy. i love bullet-hell games. and thus, candy strike was born.
i had been wanting to get into coding that wasn't block coding for a while, and after discovering the athena award i decided to give it a shot. i really liked the idea of a candy themed fighting game so, after watching a few quick tutorials on godot to get the gist of the engine, i began designing and coding this game. my focus on this game wasn't on story but more on giving the enemies and main character some character (which i hope i did)

**how?**

this project was in made in godot using GDScript. i found godot to be much easier and less overwhelming than unity, and unlike the other engines, im actually going to stick with this one!!

**struggles**

i faced many, many, many, many bugs, both big and small. one major bug i faced required such a simple solution that i completely overlooked (one keyframe in an animation was moving the player to 0,0, i wrote about this in a commit!) so i ended up overcomplicating it, and that taught me to always always look at the most obvious, simple things first and foremost, even if i dont think its the issue, because it might save so so much time 

from all of that, though, i created a sort of debugging process I follow with every bug. i learned the power of printing and also isolating elements to find out what is causing what. the biggest issue i faced throughout the entirety of this project was animation bugs. they constantly overlapped eachother, wouldnt play, and it ended up looking pretty bad. however!! i fixed that bug to the best of my ability and it seems to be completely gone!! i couldnt tell you how i fixed it because i've gone through so many iterations of the fix that i cant even remember, but i can say that it taught me not to give up and the power of simply taking breaks if i got frustrated rather than quitting, a lesson that was pretty consistent throughout my time working on this project. also..the art...oh man..the art took so long...
